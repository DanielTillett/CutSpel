				<h3>Cut Spelling</h3>
				<p>English spelling is notoriously inconsistent and archaic. 
				 Many of the English words that cause the most
				 problems are those containing redundant letters. Just eliminating
				 redundant letters solves many spelling difficulties 
				 without significantly changing the  appearance and use of written English.</p>
				 <p>This idea was developed by Christopher Upward and colleagues into <i>Cut Spelling</i>.
				 This simple reform removes redundant letters, along with a small number of 
				 letter substitutions, to improve English spelling and speed writing.</p>
				<h3>CutSpel</h3>
				<p><strong>CutSpel</strong> implements a subset of <i>Cut Spelling</i> 
			    to automatically 'cut' the text of any webpage. <strong>CutSpel</strong> has two modes.</p>
				<h4>Basic Mode</h4>
				<p>Modifies the 1000 most common English word language while 
				avoiding the more disruptive <i>Cut Spelling</i> changes such as eye -> y. 
				Names of people and objects are left unchanged. 
				The text generated by this mode is  easy to read.</p>
				<h4>Advanced Mode</h4>
				<p>Modifies the 4500 most common English words and uses the full 
				<i>Cut Spelling</i> substitution rules. The text produced by the advanced mode 
				requires slightly more effort to read, however most people quickly adjust
				and are reading at their normal pace after only a few hours.</p>
